// Assigning string literal to a pointer
// char *ptr = "Hello";
// ptr contain the address of first character of string literal
// "Hello"[1] is equivelent to 'H'[1]
// pointer to 'H'[1] = *(pointer to 'H' + 1)

// some point to be noted
// string literal cannot be modefied. it caused undefined behaviour
