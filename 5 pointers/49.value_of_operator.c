//value of operator/indirection operator/dereference operator is an operator that is used to access the value stored at hte location pointed by the pointer.
//we can also change the value of the object pointed by the pointer.

//Never apply the indirection operator to the uninitialized pointers
// int *prt;
// printf("%d\n",*prt);//this will give an error

//Assigning value to an uninitialized pointer is dangerous.
// int *ptr;
// *ptr = 5;//this will give an error
