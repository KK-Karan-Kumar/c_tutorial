// Advantages
// Every recursive program can be modeled into iterative program but recursive program are more elegent and require less line of code

// Disadvantages
// Recursive program can be very slow in some cases
// Recursive program can be very memory consuming in some cases
// Recursive program can be very hard to debug in some cases
// Recursive program can be very hard to understand in some cases
// Recursive program can be very hard to maintain in some cases
// Recursive program can be very hard to modify in some cases
