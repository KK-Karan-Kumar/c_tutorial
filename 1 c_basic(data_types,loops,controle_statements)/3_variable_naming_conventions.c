    # Rule 1 : don't start variable name with digit.
    # Rule 2 : begining with underscore is valid but not recommended.
    # Rule 3 : C langauge is case sensitive. uppercase letters are different form lowercase letters
    # Rule 4 : special character (@,#,%,^,&,*,..) not allowed inthe name of variable.
    # Rule 5 : Blanks or white space not allowed.
    # Rule 6 : Don't use keywords to name your variables.
    Tip : do not use long namefor your variables
